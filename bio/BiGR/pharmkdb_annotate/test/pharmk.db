981755803	rs75527207	CFTR (PA109)	1A	Efficacy	1451288446;1451288447;1451288448	AA:Patients with the AA genotype (two copies of the CFTR G551D variant) and cystic fibrosis may respond to ivacaftor treatment. FDA-approved drug labeling information and CPIC guidelines indicate use of ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patients with at least one copy of a list of 33 CFTR genetic variants, including G551D. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence a patient's response to ivacaftor.; AG:Patients with the AG genotype (one copy of the CFTR G551D variant) and cystic fibrosis may respond to ivacaftor treatment. FDA-approved drug labeling information and CPIC guidelines indicate use of ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patients with at least one copy of a list of 33 CFTR genetic variants, including G551D. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence a patient's response to ivacaftor.; GG:Patients with the GG genotype (do not have a copy of the CFTR G551D variant) and cystic fibrosis have an unknown response to ivacaftor treatment, as response may depend on the presence of other CFTR variants. FDA-approved drug labeling information and CPIC guidelines indicate use of ivacaftor in cystic fibrosis patients with at least one copy of a list of 33 CFTR genetic variants, including G551D. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence a patient's response to ivacaftor.	981755665;981755678;982006840;982009991;1043737597;1043737620;1043737636;1183629335;1448267532;1448423752;1449191908;1449192031;1449192055;1449192093;1449192439;1449192481;1449192494;1449192576;1449192615;1449192709;1449192721;1450043422;1184512440;981755746;981755699;981755787;1446903789;1448099051	Genotypes AA + AG are associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Genotypes AA + AG are associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in men with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in children with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with increased activity of CFTR when treated with ivacaftor in transfected CHO cells.;Allele A is associated with activity of CFTR when treated with ivacaftor in FRT cell lines.;Genotype AA is associated with response to ivacaftor in women with Cystic Fibrosis.;Genotypes AA + AG is associated with decreased severity of bone density when treated with ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis as compared to genotype GG.;Genotypes AA + AG is associated with increased response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis as compared to genotype GG.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with decreased likelihood of cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation when treated with ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in children with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in children with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Allele A is associated with increased response to ivacaftor.;Allele A is associated with increased response to ivacaftor.;Allele A is associated with increased response to ivacaftor.;Genotypes AA + AG are associated with response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis.;Genotypes AA + AG are associated with increased response to ivacaftor in people with Cystic Fibrosis as compared to genotype GG.	19846789;21083385;22047557;22293084;22942289;23313410;23590265;23628510;23757359;23757361;23891399;24066763;24461666;25049054;25145599;25171465;25311995;25473543;25682022;25755212;26135562;26568242;27158673;27745802;27773592;28611235;28651844;28711222	28	ivacaftor (PA165950341)	Cystic Fibrosis (PA443829)	Mixed Population	chr7	2020-11-0
