notes: |
  * The `java_opts` param allows for additional arguments to be passed to the java compiler, e.g. "-XX:ParallelGCThreads=10" (not for `-XmX` or `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, since they are handled automatically).
  * The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments.
  * `--TMP_DIR` is automatically set by `resources.tmpdir`
