Multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule clustalo:
        input:
            "{sample}.fa"
        output:
            "{sample}.msa.fa"
        params:
            extra=""
        log:
            "logs/clustalo/test/{sample}.log"
        threads: 8
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/clustalo"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
