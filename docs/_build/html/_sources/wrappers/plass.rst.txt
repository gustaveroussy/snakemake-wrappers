PLASS
=====

Plass (Protein-Level ASSembler) is software to assemble short read sequencing data on a protein level. The main purpose of Plass is the assembly of complex metagenomic datasets.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule plass_paired:
        input:
            left=["reads/reads.left.fq.gz", "reads/reads2.left.fq.gz"],
            right=["reads/reads.right.fq.gz", "reads/reads2.right.fq.gz"] 
        output:
            "plass/prot.fasta"
        log:
            "logs/plass.log"
        params:
            extra=""
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/plass"

    rule plass_single:
        input:
            single=["reads/reads.left.fq.gz", "reads/reads2.left.fq.gz"],
        output:
            "plass/prot_single.fasta"
        log:
            "logs/plass_single.log"
        params:
            extra=""
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/plass"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
