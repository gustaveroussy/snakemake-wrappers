.. _`ngs-disambiguate`:

NGS-DISAMBIGUATE
================

Disambiguation algorithm for reads aligned to two species (e.g. human
and mouse genomes) from Tophat, Hisat2, STAR or BWA mem.






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule disambiguate:
        input:
            a="mapped/{sample}.a.bam",
            b="mapped/{sample}.b.bam"
        output:
            a_ambiguous='disambiguate/{sample}.graft.ambiguous.bam',
            b_ambiguous='disambiguate/{sample}.host.ambiguous.bam',
            a_disambiguated='disambiguate/{sample}.graft.bam',
            b_disambiguated='disambiguate/{sample}.host.bam',
            summary='qc/disambiguate/{sample}.txt'
        params:
            algorithm="bwa",
            # optional: Prefix to use for output. If omitted, a
            # suitable value is guessed from the output paths. Prefix
            # is used for the intermediate output paths, as well as
            # sample name in summary file.
            prefix="{sample}",
            extra=""
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/ngs-disambiguate"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
