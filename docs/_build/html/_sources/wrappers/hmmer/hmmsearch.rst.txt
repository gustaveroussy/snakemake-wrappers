HMMSEARCH
=========

search profile(s) against a sequence database





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule hmmsearch_profile:
        input:
            fasta="test-protein.fa",
            profile="test-profile.hmm.h3f",
        output:
            # only one of these is required
            tblout="test-prot-tbl.txt", # save parseable table of per-sequence hits to file <f>
            domtblout="test-prot-domtbl.txt", # save parseable table of per-domain hits to file <f>
            alignment_hits="test-prot-alignment-hits.txt", # Save a multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying inclusion thresholds) to the file <f>
            outfile="test-prot-out.txt", # Direct the main human-readable output to a file <f> instead of the default stdout. 
        log:
            "logs/hmmsearch.log"
        params:
            evalue_threshold=0.00001,
            # if bitscore threshold provided, hmmsearch will use that instead
            #score_threshold=50,
            extra="",
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/hmmer/hmmsearch"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
