hmmbuild: construct profile HMM(s) from multiple sequence alignment(s)





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule hmmbuild_profile:
        input:
            "test-profile.sto"
        output:
            "test-profile.hmm"
        log:
            "logs/test-profile-hmmbuild.log"
        params:
            extra="",
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/hmmer/hmmbuild"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
