SAMTOOLS BAM2FQ INTERLEAVED
===========================

Convert a bam file back to unaligned reads in a single fastq file with samtools. For paired end reads, this results in an unsorted interleaved file.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule samtools_bam2fq_interleaved:
        input:
            "mapped/{sample}.bam"
        output:
            "reads/{sample}.fq"
        params:
            " "
        threads: 3
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/samtools/bam2fq/interleaved"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
