.. _`samtools sort`:

SAMTOOLS SORT
=============

Sort bam file with samtools.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule samtools_sort:
        input:
            "mapped/{sample}.bam"
        output:
            "mapped/{sample}.sorted.bam"
        params:
            "-m 4G"
        threads:  # Samtools takes additional threads through its option -@
            8     # This value - 1 will be sent to -@.
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/samtools/sort"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

* Samtools -@/--threads takes one integer as input. This is the number of additional threads and not raw threads.
