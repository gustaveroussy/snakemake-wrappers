.. _`samtools merge`:

SAMTOOLS MERGE
==============

Merge two bam files with samtools.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule samtools_merge:
        input:
            ["mapped/A.bam", "mapped/B.bam"]
        output:
            "merged.bam"
        params:
            "" # optional additional parameters as string
        threads:  # Samtools takes additional threads through its option -@
            8     # This value - 1 will be sent to -@
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/samtools/merge"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

* Samtools -@/--threads takes one integer as input. This is the number of additional threads and not raw threads.
