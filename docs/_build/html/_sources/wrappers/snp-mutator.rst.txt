SNP-MUTATOR
===========

Generate mutated sequence files from a reference genome.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    NUM_SIMULATIONS = 2

    rule snpmutator:
        input:
            "{sample}.fa"
        output:
            vcf = "{sample}.mutated.vcf",
            sequences = expand(
                "{{sample}}_mutated_{simulation_number}.fasta",
                simulation_number=range(1, NUM_SIMULATIONS + 1)
            )
        params:
            num_simulations = NUM_SIMULATIONS,
            extra = " ".join([
                "--num-substitutions 2",
                "--num-insertions 2",
                "--num-deletions 0"
            ]),
        log:
            "logs/snp-mutator/test/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/snp-mutator"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
