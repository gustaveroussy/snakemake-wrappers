PALADIN ALIGN
=============

Align nucleotide reads to a protein fasta file (that has been indexed with paladin index). PALADIN is a protein sequence alignment tool designed for the accurate functional characterization of metagenomes.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule paladin_align:
        input:
            reads=["reads/reads.left.fq.gz"], 
            index="index/prot.fasta.bwt", 
        output:
            "paladin_mapped/{sample}.bam" # will output BAM format if output file ends with ".bam", otherwise SAM format
        log:
            "logs/paladin/{sample}.log"
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/paladin/align"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
