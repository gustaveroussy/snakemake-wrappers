RAZERS3
=======

Mapping (short) reads against a reference sequence. Can have multiple output formats, please see https://github.com/seqan/seqan/tree/master/apps/razers3





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule razers3:
        input:
            # list of input reads
            reads=["reads/{sample}.1.fastq", "reads/{sample}.2.fastq"]
        output:
            # output format is automatically inferred from file extension. Can be bam/sam or other formats.
            "mapped/{sample}.bam"
        log:
            "logs/razers3/{sample}.log"
        params:
            # the reference genome
            genome="genome.fasta",
            # additional parameters
            extra=""
        threads: 8
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/razers3"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
