SOMATIC_SIGNATURES
==================

Filter a VRange file and keep only SNVs





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_VariantAnnotation_isSNV:
        input:
            calls = "calls.rds"
        output:
            rds = "snv.rds"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/VariantAnnotation/isSNV"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

This wrapper exists because SomaticSignatures only takes SNP into account
