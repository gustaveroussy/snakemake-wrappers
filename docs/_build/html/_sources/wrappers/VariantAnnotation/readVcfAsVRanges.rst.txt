SOMATIC_SIGNATURES
==================

Load VCF file as VRange object





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_VariantAnnotation_readVcfAsVRange:
        input:
            calls = "calls.vcf.gz",
            tbi = "calls.vcf.gz.tbi"
        output:
            rds = "calls.rds"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/VariantAnnotation/readVcfAsVRanges"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

Requires both vcf and tabix file to work.
