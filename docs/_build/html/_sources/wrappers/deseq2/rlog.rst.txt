.. _`rlog`:

RLOG
====

Apply a rlog transformation on deseq2 datasets





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_rlog:
        input:
            dds = "dds.RDS"
        output:
            rds = "rlog.RDS",
            tsv = "rlog.tsv"
        message:
            "Testing DESeq2 rlogTransformation"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 1024, 2048)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 10, 20)
            )
        log:
            "logs/test_rlog.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/deseq2/rlog"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
