HISAT2 ALIGN
============

Map reads with hisat2.






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule hisat2_align:
        input:
          idx = "index/",
          reads=["reads/{sample}_R1.fastq", "reads/{sample}_R2.fastq"]
        output:
          "mapped/{sample}.bam"
        log:
            "logs/hisat2_align_{sample}.log"
        params:
          extra = ""
        threads: 2
        wrapper:
          "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/hisat2/align"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

* The `-S` flag must not be used since output is already directly piped to
  `samtools` for compression.
* The `--threads/-p` flag must not be used since threads is set separately
  via the snakemake `threads` directive.
* The wrapper does not yet handle SRA input accessions.
* No reference index files checking is done since the actual number of files
  may differ depending on the reference sequence size. This is also why
  the index is supplied in the `params` directive instead of the `input`
  directive.
