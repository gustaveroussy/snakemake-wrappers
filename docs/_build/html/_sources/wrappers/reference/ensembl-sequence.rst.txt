.. _`ensembl-sequence`:

ENSEMBL-SEQUENCE
================

Download sequences (e.g. genome) from ENSEMBL FTP servers, and store them in a single .fasta file.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule get_genome:
        output:
            "refs/genome.fasta"
        params:
            species="saccharomyces_cerevisiae",
            datatype="dna",
            build="R64-1-1",
            release="98"
        log:
            "logs/get_genome.log"
        cache: True  # save space and time with between workflow caching (see docs)
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/reference/ensembl-sequence"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
