ENSEMBL-ANNOTATION
==================

Download annotation of genomic sites (e.g. transcripts) from ENSEMBL FTP servers, and store them in a single .gtf or .gff3 file.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule get_annotation:
        output:
            "refs/annotation.gtf"
        params:
            species="homo_sapiens",
            release="87",
            build="GRCh37",
            fmt="gtf",
            flavor="" # optional, e.g. chr_patch_hapl_scaff, see Ensembl FTP.
        log:
            "logs/get_annotation.log"
        cache: True  # save space and time with between workflow caching (see docs)
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/reference/ensembl-annotation"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
