ENSEMBL-VARIATION
=================

Download known genomic variants from ENSEMBL FTP servers, and store them in a single .vcf.gz file.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule get_variation:
        output:
            vcf="refs/variation.vcf.gz"
            # Optional: add fai to get VCF with annotated contig lengths (as required by GATK)
            # and properly sorted VCFs.
            # fai="refs/genome.fasta.fai"
        params:
            species="saccharomyces_cerevisiae",
            release="98", # releases <98 are unsupported
            build="R64-1-1",
            type="all" # one of "all", "somatic", "structural_variation"
        log:
            "logs/get_variation.log"
        cache: True  # save space and time with between workflow caching (see docs)
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/reference/ensembl-variation"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
