.. _`transdecoder predict`:

TRANSDECODER PREDICT
====================

Predict the likely coding regions from the ORFs identified by Transdecoder.LongOrfs. Optionally include results from homology searches (blast/hmmer results) as ORF retention criteria.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule transdecoder_predict:
        input:
            fasta="test.fa.gz", # required input; optionally gzipped
            pfam_hits="pfam_hits.txt", # optionally retain ORFs with hits by inputting pfam results here (run separately)
            blastp_hits="blastp_hits.txt", # optionally retain ORFs with hits by inputting blastp results here (run separately) 
            # you may also want to add your transdecoder longorfs result here - predict will fail if you haven't first run longorfs
            #longorfs="test.fa.transdecoder_dir/longest_orfs.pep"
        output:
            "test.fa.transdecoder.bed",
            "test.fa.transdecoder.cds",
            "test.fa.transdecoder.pep",
            "test.fa.transdecoder.gff3"
        log:
            "logs/transdecoder/test-predict.log"
        params:
            extra=""
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/transdecoder/predict"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
