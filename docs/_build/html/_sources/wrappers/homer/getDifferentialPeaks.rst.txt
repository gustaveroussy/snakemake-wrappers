Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule homer_getDifferentialPeaks:
        input:
            # peak/bed file to be tested
            peaks="{sample}.peaks.bed",
            # tagDirectory of first sample
            first="tagDir/{sample}",
            # tagDirectory of sample to compare
            second="tagDir/second"
        output:
            "{sample}_diffPeaks.txt"
        params:
            extra=""  # optional params, see homer manual
        log:
            "logs/diffPeaks/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.76.0-830-g11cd3a609/bio/homer/getDifferentialPeaks"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
