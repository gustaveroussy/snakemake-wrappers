Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule homer_findPeaks:
        input:
            # tagDirectory of sample
            tag="tagDir/{sample}",
            # tagDirectory of control background sample - optional
            control="tagDir/control"
        output:
            "{sample}_peaks.txt"
        params:
            # one of 7 basic modes of operation, see homer manual
            style="histone",
            extra=""  # optional params, see homer manual
        log:
            "logs/findPeaks/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/homer/findPeaks"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
