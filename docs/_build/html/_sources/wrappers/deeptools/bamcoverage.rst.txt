.. _`bamCoverage`:

BAMCOVERAGE
===========

Generate a coverage track from alignment of reads or fragments






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_deeptools_bamcoverage:
        input:
            bam = "a.bam"
        output:
            coverage = "a.bedgraph"
        message:
            "Testing deeptools bamcoverage"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 1024, 10240)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 20, 200)
            )
        log:
            "logs/test_deeptools_bamcoverage.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/deeptools/bamcoverage"


    rule test_deeptools_bamcoverage_regions:
        input:
            bam = "a.bam"
        output:
            coverage = "a.{regions}.bw"
        message:
            "Testing deeptools bamcoverage ({wildcards.regions})"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 1024, 10240)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 20, 200)
            )
        log:
            "logs/test_deeptools_bamcoverage_{regions}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/deeptools/bamcoverage"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

You can specify regions in the file name. See example
