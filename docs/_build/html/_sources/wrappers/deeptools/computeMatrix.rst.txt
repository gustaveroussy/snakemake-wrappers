.. _`computeMatrix`:

COMPUTEMATRIX
=============

Calculate scores per genome regions and prepare intermediate
files for DeepTools






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_deeptools_computeMatrix:
        input:
            scores = "a.bw",
            regions = "genome.bed"
        output:
            gzip = "archive.gz",
            matrix = "matrix.tsv",
            regions = "regions.bed"
        message:
            "Testing deeptools bamcoverage"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 1024, 10240)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 20, 200)
            )
        log:
            "logs/test_deeptools_bamcoverage.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/deeptools/computeMatrix"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

Output files are optional, use gzip, matrix, and/or regions keywords in
output section to (dis)enable each of them.
