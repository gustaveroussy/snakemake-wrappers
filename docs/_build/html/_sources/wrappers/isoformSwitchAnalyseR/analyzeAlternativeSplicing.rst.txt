.. _`analyzeAlternativeSplicing`:

ANALYZEALTERNATIVESPLICING
==========================

Predict alternative splicing





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_analyze_alternative_splicing:
        input:
            switch_list = "switch_list.RDS"
        output:
            "splice_analyzed.RDS"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/isoformSwitchAnalyzeR/analyzeAlternativeSplicing"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

The input switch list should have Sequence extracted, CPAT/Pfam results
included, and should be tested for differential analysis result.
