SEQTK-SUBSAMPLE-SE
==================

Subsample reads from FASTQ file






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule seqtk_subsample_se:
        input:
            "{sample}.fastq.gz"
        output:
            "{sample}.subsampled.fastq.gz"
        params:
            n=3,
            seed=12345
        log:
            "logs/seqtk_subsample/{sample}.log"
        threads:
            1
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/seqtk/subsample/se"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
