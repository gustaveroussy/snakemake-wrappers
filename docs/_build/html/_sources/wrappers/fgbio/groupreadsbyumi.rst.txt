FGBIO GROUPREADSBYUMI
=====================

Groups reads together that appear to have come from the same original molecule.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule GroupReads:
        input:
            "mapped/a.bam"
        output:
            bam="mapped/{sample}.gu.bam",
            hist="mapped/{sample}.gu.histo.tsv",
        params:
            extra="-s adjacency --edits 1"
        log:
            "logs/fgbio/group_reads/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/fgbio/groupreadsbyumi"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
