FGBIO FILTERCONSENSUSREADS
==========================

Filters consensus reads generated by CallMolecularConsensusReads or CallDuplexConsensusReads.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule FilterConsensusReads:
        input:
            "mapped/{sample}.bam"
        output:
            "mapped/{sample}.filtered.bam"
        params:
            extra="",
            min_base_quality=2,
            min_reads=[2, 2, 2],
            ref="genome.fasta"
        log:
            "logs/fgbio/filterconsensusreads/{sample}.log"
        threads: 1
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/fgbio/filterconsensusreads"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

* min_base_quality: a single value (Int). Mask (make N) consensus bases with quality less than this threshold. (default: 5)
* min_reads: n array of Ints, max length 3, min length 1. Number of reads that need to support a UMI. For filtering bam files processed with CallMolecularConsensusReads one value is required. 3 values can be provided for bam files processed with CallDuplexConsensusReads, if fewer than 3 are provided the last value will be repeated, the first value is for the final consensus sequence and the two last for each strands consensus.
