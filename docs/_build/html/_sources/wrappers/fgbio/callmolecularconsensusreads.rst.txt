.. _`fgbio CallMolecularConsensusReads`:

FGBIO CALLMOLECULARCONSENSUSREADS
=================================

Calls consensus sequences from reads with the same unique molecular tag.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule ConsensusReads:
        input:
            "mapped/a.bam"
        output:
            "mapped/{sample}.m3.bam"
        params:
            extra="-M 3"
        log:
            "logs/fgbio/consensus_reads/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/fgbio/callmolecularconsensusreads"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
