VARSCAN MPILEUP2SNP
===================

Detect variants in NGS data from Samtools mpileup





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule mpileup_to_vcf:
        input:
            "mpileup/{sample}.mpileup.gz"
        output:
            "vcf/{sample}.vcf"
        message:
            "Calling SNP with Varscan2"
        threads:  # Varscan does not take any threading information
            1     # However, mpileup might have to be unzipped.
                  # Keep threading value to one for unzipped mpileup input
                  # Set it to two for zipped mipileup files
        log:
            "logs/varscan_{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/varscan/mpileup2snp"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

Varscan does not take any threading information by itself. However, mpileup
files given as input, might be gzipped.

If so, it's recommended to use two threads:

* 1 for varscan itself
* 1 for zcat
