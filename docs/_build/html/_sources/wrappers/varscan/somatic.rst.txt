VARSCAN SOMATIC
===============

Varscan Somatic calls variants and identifies their somatic status (Germline/LOH/Somatic) using pileup files from a matched tumor-normal pair.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule varscan_somatic:
        input:
            # A pair of pileup files can be used *instead* of the mpileup
            # normal_pileup = ""
            # tumor_pileup = ""
            mpileup = "mpileup/{sample}.mpileup.gz"
        output:
            snp = "vcf/{sample}.snp.vcf",
            indel = "vcf/{sample}.indel.vcf"
        message:
            "Calling somatic variants {wildcards.sample}"
        threads:
            1
        params:
            extra = ""
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/varscan/somatic"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
