.. _`mutational_context`:

MUTATIONAL_CONTEXT
==================

Compute mutational context





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_mutationContext:
        input:
            call = "calls.rds",
            sequence = "sequence.rds"
        output:
            rds = "context.rds"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/SomaticSignatures/mutationContext"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

See VariantAnnotation and Rsamtools wrappers for input requirements.
