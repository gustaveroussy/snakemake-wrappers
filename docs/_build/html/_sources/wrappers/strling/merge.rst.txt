STRLING MERGE
=============

STRling (pronounced “sterling”) is a method to detect large short tandem repeat (STR) expansions from short-read sequencing data. ``merge`` prepares joint calling of STR loci across all given samples. Requires minimum read evidence from at least one sample. Documentation at: https://strling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule strling_merge:
        input:
            bins=["extract/A.bin", "extract/B.bin"],
            reference="reference/genome.fasta",
            fai="reference/genome.fasta.fai",
        output:
            "merged/group-bounds.txt" # must end with "-bounds.txt"
        params:
            extra="" # optionally add further command line arguments
        log:
            "log/strling/merge/group.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/strling/merge"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
