STRLING CALL
============

STRling (pronounced like “sterling”) is a method to detect large short tandem repeat (STR) expansions from short-read sequencing data. ``call`` calls genotypes/estimate allele sizes for all loci in each sample. Documentation at: https://strling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule strling_call:
        input:
            bam="mapped/{sample}.bam",
            bai="mapped/{sample}.bam.bai",
            bin="extract/{sample}.bin",
            reference="reference/genome.fasta",
            fai="reference/genome.fasta.fai",
            bounds="merged/group-bounds.txt" # optional, produced by strling merge
        output:
            "call/{sample}-bounds.txt", # must end with -bounds.txt
            "call/{sample}-genotype.txt", # must end with -genotype.txt
            "call/{sample}-unplaced.txt" # must end with -unplaced.txt
        params:
            extra="" # optional extra command line arguments
        log:
            "log/strling/call/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/strling/call" 


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
