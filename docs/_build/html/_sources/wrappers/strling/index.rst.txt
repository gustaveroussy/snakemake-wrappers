STRLING INDEX
=============

STRling (pronounced like “sterling”) is a method to detect large short tandem repeat (STR) expansions from short-read sequencing data. ``index`` creates a bed file of large STR regions in the reference genome. This step is performed automatically as part of ``strling extract``. However, when running multiple samples, it is more efficient to do it once, then pass the file to strling extract using the ``-g`` option.

Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule strling_index:
        input:
            "reference/genome.fasta"
        output:
            index="reference/genome.fasta.str",
            fai="reference/genome.fasta.fai"
        params:
            extra="" # optionally add further command line arguments
        log:
            "log/strling/index.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/strling/index"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
