.. _`ProSolo FDR control`:

PROSOLO FDR CONTROL
===================

ProSolo can control the false discovery rate of any combination of its defined single cell events (like the presence of an alternative allele or the dropout of an allele).






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule prosolo_fdr_control:
        input:
             "variant_calling/{sc}.{bulk}.prosolo.bcf"
        output:
             "fdr_control/{sc}.{bulk}.prosolo.fdr.bcf"
        threads:
            1
        params:
            # comma-separated set of events for whose (joint)
            # false discovery rate you want to control
            events = "ADO_TO_REF,HET",
            # false discovery rate to control for
            fdr = 0.05
        log:
            "logs/prosolo_{sc}_{bulk}.fdr.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/prosolo/control-fdr"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
