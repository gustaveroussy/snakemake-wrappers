.. _`Bowtie2 build`:

BOWTIE2 BUILD
=============

Index genomes with Bowtie2-build





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_bowtie2_build:
        input:
            fasta = "genome.fa"
        output:
            directory("bwt2_index")
        params:
            # The following parameter is optional:
            # if a path to one of the files created in index is provided,
            # then the wrapper can guess the prefix itself.
            prefix = "bwt2_index/genome"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/bowtie2/build"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

If sequence are not provided as a fasta-formatted file, then they shall be given as parameters.
