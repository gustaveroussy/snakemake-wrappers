NANOSIM-H
=========

NanoSim-H is a simulator of Oxford Nanopore reads that captures the technology-specific features of ONT data, and allows for adjustments upon improvement of Nanopore sequencing technology.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule nanosimh:
        input:
            "{sample}.fa"
        output:
            reads = "{sample}.simulated.fa",
            log = "{sample}.simulated.log",
            errors = "{sample}.simulated.errors.txt"
        params:
            extra = "",
            num_reads = 10,
            perfect_reads = True,
            min_read_len = 10,
        log:
            "logs/nanosim-h/test/{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/nanosim-h"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
