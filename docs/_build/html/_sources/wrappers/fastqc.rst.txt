.. _`fastqc`:

FASTQC
======

Generate fastq qc statistics using fastqc.






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule fastqc:
        input:
            "reads/{sample}.fastq"
        output:
            html="qc/fastqc/{sample}.html",
            zip="qc/fastqc/{sample}_fastqc.zip" # the suffix _fastqc.zip is necessary for multiqc to find the file. If not using multiqc, you are free to choose an arbitrary filename
        params: ""
        log:
            "logs/fastqc/{sample}.log"
        threads: 1
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/fastqc"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
