.. _`GATK Mutect2`:

GATK MUTECT2
============

Call somatic SNVs and indels via local assembly of haplotypes





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule mutect2:
        input:
            fasta = "genome/genome.fasta",
            map = "mapped/{sample}.bam"
        output:
            vcf = "variant/{sample}.vcf"
        message:
            "Testing Mutect2 with {wildcards.sample}"
        threads:
            1
        log:
            "logs/mutect_{sample}.log"
        wrapper:
             "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/gatk/mutect"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
