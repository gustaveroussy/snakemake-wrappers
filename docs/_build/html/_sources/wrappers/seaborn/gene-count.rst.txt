SEABORN GENE BOX PLOTS
======================

Build a gene box-plot





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_gene_box_count:
        input:
            counts = "table.tsv"
        output:
            dir = directory("gene_plots")
        message:
            "Testing boxp lot of normalized counts"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 512, 10240)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 5, 200)
            )
        params:
            targets = ["ENST00000002596.5", "ENST00000001146.6"],
            condition = {"Sample_01": "A",
                         "Sample_02": "A",
                         "Sample_03": "A",
                         "Sample_07": "B",
                         "Sample_08": "B",
                         "Sample_09": "B",}
        log:
            "logs/test_box_count.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/seaborn/gene-count"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
