TRINITY
=======

Generate transcriptome assembly with Trinity






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python


    rule trinity:
        input:
            left=["reads/reads.left.fq.gz", "reads/reads2.left.fq.gz"],
            right=["reads/reads.right.fq.gz", "reads/reads2.right.fq.gz"] 
        output:
            "trinity_out_dir/Trinity.fasta"
        log:
            'logs/trinity/trinity.log'
        params:
            extra=""
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/trinity"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
