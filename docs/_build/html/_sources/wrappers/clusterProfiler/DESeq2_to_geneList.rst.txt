.. _`DESeq2 to geneList`:

DESEQ2 TO GENELIST
==================

Converts a DESeq2 TSV formatted result into a geneList for clusterProfiler





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_deseq2_to_genelist:
        input:
            rds = "dds.RDS"
        output:
            gene_lists = directory("geneLists")
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/clusterProfiler/DESeq2_to_geneList"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

The geneList contains three features:

* numeric vector: fold change or other type of numerical variable
* named vector: every number was named by the corresponding gene ID
* sorted vector: number should be sorted in decreasing order


Parameters:

* alpha_threshold: The padj threshold used to filter non significative events
* fc_threshold: The fold change threshold used to filter non significative events
* keytype: The type of genes identifiers used in DESeq2 eg: ENSEMBL, SYMBOL, ...
