.. _`Barplot`:

BARPLOT
=======

Draw a bar plot from enriched terms





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_enrich_barplot:
        input:
            rds = "enriched.RDS"
        output:
            png = "barplot.png"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/clusterProfiler/barplot"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

Use clusterProfiler enrichXXX to get enriched terms. This may also be used
with gseXXX, but you might want to consider GSEA-like plots.

Parameters:
  * barplot_extra: Extra parameters for barplot
