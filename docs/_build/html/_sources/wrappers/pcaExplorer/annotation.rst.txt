.. _`pcaExplorer Annotation`:

PCAEXPLORER ANNOTATION
======================

Prepare annotation object for pcaExplorer





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_pcaexplorer_annotation:
        input:
            dds = "dds.RDS",
            tr2gene = "tr2gene.tsv"
        output:
            annotation  = "annot.RDS"
        message:
            "Testing annotation wrapper"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 1024, 10240)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 20, 200)
            )
        log:
            "logs/test_pcaexplorer_annotation.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/pcaExplorer/annotation"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
