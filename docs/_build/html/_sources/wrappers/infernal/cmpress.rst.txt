INFERNAL CMPRESS
================

Starting from a CM database <cmfile> in standard Infernal-1.1 format, construct binary compressed datafiles for cmscan. Infernal ('INFERence of RNA ALignment') is for searching DNA sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule infernal_cmpress:
        input:
            "test-covariance-model.cm"
        output:
            "test-covariance-model.cm.i1i",
            "test-covariance-model.cm.i1f",
            "test-covariance-model.cm.i1m",
            "test-covariance-model.cm.i1p"
        log:
            "logs/cmpress.log"
        params:
            extra="",
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/infernal/cmpress"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
