INFERNAL CMSCAN
===============

cmscan is used to search sequences against collections of covariance models that have been prepared with cmpress. The output format is designed to be human-            readable, but is often so voluminous that reading it is impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The --tblout option saves output in a simple tabular  format that is concise and easier to parse. The -o option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it away in /dev/null. Infernal ('INFERence of RNA ALignment') is for searching DNA sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule cmscan_profile:
        input:
            fasta="test-transcript.fa",
            profile="test-covariance-model.cm.i1i"
        output:
            tblout="tr-infernal-tblout.txt",
        log:
            "logs/cmscan.log"
        params:
            evalue_threshold=10, # In the per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of <= <x>. default=10.0 (on average, ~10 false positives reported per query)
            extra= "",
            #score_threshold=50, # Instead of thresholding per-CM output on E-value, report target sequences with a bit score of >= <x>. 
        threads: 4
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/infernal/cmscan"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
