UNICYCLER
=========

Assemble bacterial genomes with Unicycler





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_unicycler:
        input:
            short1 = "reads/reads.R1.fq.gz",
            short2 = "reads/reads.R2.fq.gz"
        output:
            "result/assembly.fasta"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/unicycler"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
