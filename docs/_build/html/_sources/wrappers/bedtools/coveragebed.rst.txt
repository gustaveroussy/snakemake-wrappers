Returns the depth and breadth of coverage of features from B on the intervals in A.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule coverageBed:
        input:
            a="bed/{sample}.bed",
            b="mapped/{sample}.bam"
        output:
            "stats/{sample}.cov"
        log:
            "logs/coveragebed/{sample}.log"
        params:
            extra=""  # optional parameters
        threads: 8
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/bedtools/coveragebed"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
