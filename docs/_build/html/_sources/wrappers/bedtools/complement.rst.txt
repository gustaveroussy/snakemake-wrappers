.. _`complement`:

COMPLEMENT
==========

Compute all genomic intervals that are not covered by at least
one record from the input file.






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_bedtools_complement:
        input:
            intervals = "intervals.bed",
            genome = "small.genome"
        output:
            "complement.bed"
        message:
            "Testing bedtools complement"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 1024, 10240)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 20, 200)
            )
        log:
            "logs/test_bedtools_complement.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/bedtools/complement"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

Eventhough it is not mentionned in the official documentation:

* GTF seems to be accepted as well as GFF.
* genome intervals is a two columned bed file.
