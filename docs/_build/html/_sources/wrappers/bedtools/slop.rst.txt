.. _`bedtools slop`:

BEDTOOLS SLOP
=============

Increase the size of each feature in a BED/BAM/VCF by a specified factor.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule bedtools_merge:
        input:
            "A.bed"
        output:
            "A.slop.bed"
        params:
            ## Genome file, tab-seperated file defining the length of every contig
            genome="genome.txt",
            ## Add optional parameters
            extra = "-b 10" ## in this example, we want to increase the feature by 10 bases to both sides
        log:
            "logs/slop/A.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/bedtools/slop"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
