.. _`delly`:

DELLY
=====

Call variants with delly.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule delly:
        input:
            ref="genome.fasta",
            samples=["mapped/a.bam"],
            # optional exclude template (see https://github.com/dellytools/delly)
            exclude="human.hg19.excl.tsv"
        output:
            "sv/calls.bcf"
        params:
            extra=""  # optional parameters for delly (except -g, -x)
        log:
            "logs/delly.log"
        threads: 2  # It is best to use as many threads as samples
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/delly"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
