.. _`cp (bash)`:

CP (BASH)
=========

Simple cp from bash.





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule cp_target:
        input:
            "source/{input}"
        output:
            "destination/{input}"
        params:
            extra = "",
            cold_storage = "../cold_storage.yaml"
        threads: 1
        conda: "../environment.yaml"
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 256, 768)
            )
        message:
            "Testing cp"
        log:
            "logs/cp/{input}.logs"
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-225-gb77af9ed/bio/cp/"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

Why ? I just wanted to test a simple case. Thus it's fair for hard copy over
symbolic linking automatic choices
