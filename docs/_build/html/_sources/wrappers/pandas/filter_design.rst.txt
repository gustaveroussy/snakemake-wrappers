.. _`Filter design`:

FILTER DESIGN
=============

Filter a design file





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_filter_design:
        input:
            design = "design.tsv"
        output:
            tsv = "filtered/design.tsv"
        message:
            "Testing design filter"
        threads:
            1
        resources:
            mem_mb = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 512, 1024)
            ),
            time_min = (
                lambda wildcards, attempt: min(attempt * 10, 20)
            )
        params:
            keep_column = ["Cond"],
            keep_sample = ["SRR493366_1.fastq", "SRR493369_1.fastq"]
        log:
            "logs/filter_design.log"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-212-g458009d7/bio/pandas/filter_design"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.



Notes
-----

There should be a column named "Sample_id". This will be the index of the
dataframe.

Parameters:

* keep_sample: A lit of samples to keep. Others will be filtered out
* filter_sample: A list of samples to filter out. Others will be kept
* keep_column: A list fo columns to keep. Others will be filtered out
* filter_column: A list of columns to filter out. Others will be kept
