Example
-------

This wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule multiqc_config:
        input:
             pairwise_scatterplot = "image.png",
             clustermap_sample = "image.png",
             pca_plot = "image.png",
             pca_axes_correlation = "image.png",
        output:
            multiqc_config = "multiqc_config.yaml",
            plots = [
                temp("pairwise_scatterplot_mqc.png"),
                temp("clustermap_sample_mqc.png"),
                temp("pca_plot_mqc.png"),
                temp("pca_axes_correlation_mqc.png")
            ]
        log:
            "logs/multiqc/config.log"
        params:
            title = "My title",
            subtitle = "My subtitle that catches readers",
            intro_text = "Intro text that summs up may things",
            report_comment = "A comment about this report",
            show_analysis_paths = False,
            show_analysis_time = True,
            custom_logo = '../IGR_Logo.jpeg',
            custom_logo_url = 'https://gitlab.com/bioinfo_gustaveroussy/bigr',
            custom_logo_title = 'BiGR, Gustave Roussy Intitute',
            report_header_info = [
                {"Contact E-mail": "my_address@gustaveroussy.fr"},
                {"Application Type": "RNA-seq"},
                {"Project Type": "Application"},
                {"Sequencing Platform": "HiSeq 2500 High Output V4"},
                {"Sequencing Setup": "2x125"}
            ]
        wrapper:
            "0.77.0-1034-gee6c61611/bio/BiGR/multiqc_rnaseq_report"

Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.

When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.

Software dependencies
---------------------

* ``bioconda:multiqc=1.9``
