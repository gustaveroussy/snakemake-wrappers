IRODS_YAML
==========

Turn iRODS text answers into yaml formatted files





Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule test_iRODS_yaml:
        input:
            "iRODS.txt"
        output:
            "iRODS.yaml"
        wrapper:
            "0.65.0-211-g6a5c5194/bio/iRODS/yaml"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
