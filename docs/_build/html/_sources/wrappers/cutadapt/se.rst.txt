CUTADAPT-SE
===========

Trim single-end reads using cutadapt.






Example
-------

This meta-wrapper can be used in the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    rule cutadapt:
        input:
            "reads/{sample}.fastq"
        output:
            fastq="trimmed/{sample}.fastq",
            qc="trimmed/{sample}.qc.txt"
        params:
            "-a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC -q 20"
        log:
            "logs/cutadapt/{sample}.log"
        threads: 4 # set desired number of threads here
        wrapper:
            "0.66.0-240-gd9cffe8c/bio/cutadapt/se"


Note that input, output and log file paths can be chosen freely.
When running with

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --use-conda

the software dependencies will be automatically deployed into an isolated environment before execution.
